In this assignment, we aimed to predict survival outcomes using various supervised learning algorithms.
We started by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the data and its key features. 
This was followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
We trained several classification models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes, and assessed their performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score. 
To fine-tune the models, we used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
At the end of the process, we summarized our results, highlighted the top-performing model, and reflected on the main insights and challenges we encountered throughout the project.
This assignment provided a hands-on experience with the supervised learning workflow.
